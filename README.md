# What is this?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course, [Next.js & React - The Complete Guide (incl. Two Paths!)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/). Please have a look at the project's final showoff.

## What do you have to say?

It's been a good journey learning the NextJs framework, and certainly will use it in my future projects and careers. I love some features from it such as:

- API Routes.
- The distinguishable slugs.
- File structures.
- The config's easier.
- The script isn't as allover the place as Vanilla Reactjs library.
- Production is easy as ever.
